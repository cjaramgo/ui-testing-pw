# Short Questions

1. How would you integrate this test suite into a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions,
Jenkins)?

Playwright tests can be executed in different CI environments with different tools. To do this in Jenkins, for example, the first step would be to implement a Jenkins file containing all the pipeline stages to run these tests, using this framework. It could also be configured in other environments. Additionally, I would run these tests using Docker and, with more resources, using AWS or GCP to run in the cloud and not have to use on-premise resources.

This is an example how to set up a Jenkins file.

```
pipeline {
   agent { docker { image 'mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.51.0-noble' } }
   stages {
      stage('Run Automated Tests') {
         steps {
            sh 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
            sh 'pytest'
         }
      }
      stage('Run Alure reports') {
         steps {
            sh 'allure server AllureReport'
         }
      }
   }
}
```

2. What would be your approach to scaling this framework for a large application?

It would be a similar approach, but in a larger case I would also implement API automation to have a middle-tier approach and be able to run faster stable tests. I would implement a flaky test isolation process in order to stabilize unreliable tests. I would integrate the framework into a pipeline and implement an execution server using a containerized platform in the cloud.

3. What quality metrics would you track and report on as a QA Leader?

I would track the following metrics, because I consider the most important:

* **Test automation coverage**: This metric refers to the percentage of total test cases automated within a testing framework vs the total number of test cases.
* **Test Execution Time**: This metric refers to the duration required to execute a suite of automated tests, from setup to result reporting.
* **Defect Detection Rate**: This metric measures the effectiveness of automated tests in identifying software defects by comparing the number of defects found during automated testing to the total number of test cases executed.
* **Test Stability**: This metric measures the percentage of test executions that produce consistent and reliable outcomes over multiple runs.
